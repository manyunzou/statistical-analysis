<h3>Students' Job Placement Status Predictor</h3>

<p align="left">The goal of this project is to develop a model to predict students' job placement status based on their school performances and other demographic background. The dataset comes from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement'>Kaggle</a>, and it contains 15 features and 215 instances. The features are a mix of categorical ones, such as gender and majors, and numerical ones, such as school test results.

<p>The models I chose are kNN, Decision Trees, and SVM.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Spoiler alert</b>: after a set of efforts to improve the model performance, the overall accuracy rate increases from 69% to 85%. More importantly, the non-dominant class precision rate is boosted from around 30% to 70%.</p>
