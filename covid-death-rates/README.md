<h3>Covid Death Rate </h3>

<p align="left">This directory contains my R scripts to construct a multiple regression model to test a hypothesis: do more old people lead to more Covid-19 death cases?</p>

<p align="left">The source of data is <a href='https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data'>Our World in Data</a>, a project by the University of Oxford that hosts various datasets targeting poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality problems. The Covid-19 dataset contains many attributes, but for the purpose of this project, I only kept the following attributes:</p>

- ðŸ“„ Each country's total death number
- ðŸ“„ Population density
- ðŸ“„ the share of the population that is 65 years and older
- ðŸ“„ the total number of people who received all doses vaccine
- ðŸ“„ GDP per capita
- ðŸ“„ hospital beds per 1000 people
The data was collected as of March 21, 2023.
