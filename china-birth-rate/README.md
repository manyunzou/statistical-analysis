<h3>China Birth Rate</h3>

<p align="left">In 2023, China reached a record-low birth rate, and its population also fell for a second consecutive year.</p>

<p align="left">Born and raised in China, I was surprised to observe this change. Hence, I am trying to look into the birth rate change and the possible causes behind the decrease.</p>

<p align="left">Here are the features I tried to incorporate into my descriptive analysis and prediction model:</p>

<p align="left">After feature engineering, I noticed that many of these features have too much missing data to perform well in the model, and I had to remove them :( Please let me know if you have found some related datasets! I will keep updating this notebook.</p>
