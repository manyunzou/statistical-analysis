<h3>China Birth Rate</h3>

<p align="left">In 2023, China reached a record low birth rate, and its population also fell for a second consecutive year.</p>

<p align="left">Born and raise in China, I was surprised to observe such a news in China. Hence, I am trying to look into the birth rate change and the possible causes behinde the decrease.</p>

<p align="left">Here are all the features I put into my model and where they come from:</p>

<p align="left">Note that through feature engineering, I notice that many of these features too many missing data to be performed well in the model. I have to eliminate them because of that :( Please let me know if you have found some related datasets! I will keep updating this notebook.</p>
