<h3>Student Spending Habits</h3>

<p align="left">The goal of this project is to develop a model to classify students' preferred payment methods based on their spending habits. The dataset comes from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthnimmagadda/student-spending-dataset/data'>Kaggle</a>a>, and it consists of 18 features (including one id column) and 1,000 instances. The features are a mix of categorical ones, such as gender and year_in_school, and numerical ones, such as how much they spent on tuition and food. The models I chose are kNN, Decision Trees, and SVM.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Spoiler alert</b>b>: I failed the goal of building an efficient preferred payment method classifer because of the poor quality of the dataset. As you may notice in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNroffgccpc">my video presentation</a>, no matter what model I built and what tuning I tried, the overall accuracy rate always lies between 30% and 35%, and Kappa values are mostly negative, demonstrating disagreement between predicted values and preference values.</p>
