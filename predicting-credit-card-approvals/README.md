<h3>Credit Card Approval Predictor</h3>

<p align="left">The purpose of this project is to use supervised learning techniques, the logistic regression, to automate the credit card approval process for banks, with the data from <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval'>UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. The dataset contains 15 features and 690 instances, and the features are a mix of categorical and numerical variables.</p>

<p align="left">This project was inspired by a DataCamp project, "Predicting Credit Card Approvals", with my own scripts and notes. The coding language is Python, and the main library I am using is Scikit-learn.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Spoiler alert</b>: after a set of efforts to improve the model performance (such as hyperparameters tuning and cross-validation), I end up with a predictor reaching an overall accuracy rate of 90.75%.</p>
